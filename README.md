<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The location and concentration of charged residues in the primary structure of proteins and polypeptides modulates the conformational landscape adopted by a given sequence. The dominant structures arise through an interplay of Coulombic effects: solvation whereby charges are screened from each other and self-solvation where residues of opposite charge will form stabilising contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) measures and separates proteins electrosprayed from solution on the basis of charge and shape, and is therefore uniquely positioned to investigate these effects. Here IM-MS and molecular dynamics are used to examine how localization of charged residues alters the conformational preference of the C-terminal domain of the protein p27. Charge permutants of the wild type protein were engineered where the basic and acidic residues are distributed differently than in the primary sequence with lower (&kappa;14) and higher (&kappa;56) &kappa; parameters. The range of charge states and the accompanying collision cross section distributions as found by IM-MS distinguish each permutant despite its identical mass and amino acid composition. Wildtype p27 (&kappa;31) and the permutant where the oppositely charged residues are more evenly distributed (&kappa;14) both exhibit broad conformational landscapes suggesting highly dynamic behaviour in solution. By contrast, when the oppositely charged residues are segregated in the protein sequence (&kappa;56), the protein is conformationally constrained. The relationship between solvation and self-solvation is considered with extensive MD simulations from aqueous droplets and by adjusting the buffer salt concentration in the ESI solution. The concentration of salt modulates the population of conformers observed for each permutant and most significantly for the WT sequence, indicating that the C terminus of p27 has been optimised to present both highly solvated and highly self-solvated states.</p>
