## Figure caption

CCS distributions of each charge state of the p27-C constructs, when sprayed from 10 and 100 mM ammonium acetate; p27-C-K14 (a, d), p27-C-K31 (b, e), p27-C-K56 (c, f). The height of each peak is normalized to the relative intensity of the MS peak multiplied by the area of the IM-MS peak, as described in materials and methods. The results of 200 mM ammonium acetate are shown in Figure 1. Charge states of [M+15H]<sup>15+</sup> to [M+16H]<sup>16+</sup> of p27-C-K14 (10 mM, a), [M+15H]<sup>15+</sup> to [M+17H]<sup>17+</sup> of p27-C-K14 (100 mM, d) and [M+17H]<sup>17+</sup> of p27-C-K31 (100 mM, e) are of low signal-to-noise intensity.
