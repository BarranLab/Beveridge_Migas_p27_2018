## Figure caption

Collision Cross Section (CCS) distributions of each charge states of the p27-C permutants sprayed from 200 mM ammonium acetate solution. Charge states [M+17H]<sup>17+</sup> and [M+18H]<sup>18+</sup> for K14 and K31 and [M+13H]<sup>13+</sup> for K56 permutant are not displayed due to poor signal-to-noise in the IM-MS spectra.
