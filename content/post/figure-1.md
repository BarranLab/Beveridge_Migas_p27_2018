## Figure caption

Mass spectrum of p27-C-K14, p27-C-K31 and p27-C-K56 sprayed from 200 mM ammonium acetate. The K14 and K31 permutants display wider charge state distributions ranging from [M+6H]<sup>6+</sup> to [M+18H]<sup>18+</sup> while the K56 has a narrower distribution in the range of [M+6H]<sup>6+</sup> to [M+13H]<sup>13+</sup>. The value of the highest and lowest observed charge states and the most intense peak in the dominant distribution are indicated.
