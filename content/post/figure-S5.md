## Figure caption

CCS values of p27-C-K31 protomers starting from compact and extended conformation, covering charge states [M+5H]<sup>5+</sup> to [M+15H]<sup>15+</sup>. The overlay data represents different protomer forms of the same charge state. Compact starting structures are designated as #1-5 whereas extended as #6-10.
