[Figure 1b](https://beveridge-migas-p27.netlify.com/assets/Figure_1b.html):  Mass spectra of p27-C-κ14, p27-C-κ31 and p27-C-κ56 sprayed from 200 mM ammonium acetate. The κ14 and κ31 permutants display wider charge state distribution ranging from \[M+6H\]<sup>6+</sup> to \[M+18H\]<sup>18+</sup> whilst the κ56 in range of \[M+6H\]<sup>6+</sup>  to \[M+13H\]<sup>13+</sup>.
